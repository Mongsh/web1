  <p>An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. <strong>Every</strong> <u>solid, liquid, gas, and plasma</u> is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).

  </p><p style="margine-top:45px">Atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict this behavior.</p>
